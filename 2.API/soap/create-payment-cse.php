/**
 * Create Client-Side Encryption Payment (SOAP)
 * 
 * Merchants that require more stringent security protocols or do not want the additional overhead 
 * of managing their PCI compliance, may decide to implement Client-Side Encryption (CSE). 
 * This is particularly useful for Mobile payment flows where only cards are being offered, as 
 * it may result in faster load times and an overall improvement to the shopper flow.
 * The Adyen Hosted Payment Page (HPP) provides the most comprehensive level of PCI compliancy 
 * and you do not have any PCI obligations. Using CSE reduces your PCI scope when compared to 
 * implementing the API without encryption.
 * 
 * If you would like to implement CSE, please provide the completed PCI Self Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) 
 * A to the Adyen Support Team (support@adyen.com). The form can be found here: 
 * https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php?category=saqs
 * 
 * Please note: using our API requires a web service user. Set up your Webservice 
 * user: Adyen Test CA >> Settings >> Users >> ws@Company. >> Generate Password >> Submit
